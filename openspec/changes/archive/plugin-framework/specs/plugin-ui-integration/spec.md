## Requirements

### Requirement: Plugin Pages Support Multiple Host Integration Modes

The system SHALL support iframe, new-tab, and embedded-mount plugin page integration modes.

#### Scenario: iframe mode
- **WHEN** a plugin menu declares iframe mode
- **THEN** the host loads the plugin page in an iframe within the unified layout
- **AND** uses Lina's menu, permission, and navigation system

#### Scenario: New-tab mode
- **WHEN** a plugin menu declares new-tab mode
- **THEN** clicking the menu opens the plugin page in a new tab
- **AND** the host backend navigation state is unaffected

#### Scenario: Embedded-mount mode
- **WHEN** a plugin page declares embedded-mount mode
- **THEN** the host loads the plugin's frontend mount entry in a container
- **AND** the plugin can use any frontend framework internally
- **AND** the entry must satisfy the host's mount contract

### Requirement: Host Manages Plugin Frontend Resources

The system SHALL host plugin frontend resources and provide stable access paths.

#### Scenario: Source plugins participate in host build
- **WHEN** a source plugin provides frontend resources
- **THEN** resources participate in host frontend build
- **AND** pages are real source files, not JSON declarations
- **AND** resources are placed in `frontend/pages/` by convention
- **AND** final artifacts embed with the host binary

#### Scenario: Dynamic plugins provide frontend resources
- **WHEN** a runtime WASM plugin with resources is installed
- **THEN** the host extracts and hosts static resources
- **AND** generates stable static resource access paths
- **AND** unprepared plugin pages cannot be enabled

#### Scenario: Dynamic plugin frontend resources can come from embedded declaration
- **WHEN** a dynamic plugin author uses `go:embed` for `frontend` resources
- **THEN** the builder extracts from the embedded filesystem into the runtime snapshot
- **AND** the host continues hosting from the snapshot at `/plugin-assets/<plugin-id>/<version>/...`

### Requirement: Plugin Pages Enter Host Routing with Generation Awareness

The system SHALL include enabled plugin pages in the dynamic route system and protect user experience during generation changes.

#### Scenario: Plugin page generation refresh prompt
- **WHEN** a user is on a plugin page when that plugin hot-upgrades
- **THEN** the host shows "Plugin updated, please refresh current page"
- **AND** non-plugin-page users are not affected

#### Scenario: Refresh switches to new generation without forced navigation
- **WHEN** a user on a plugin page clicks refresh after generation change
- **THEN** the host rebuilds menus and dynamic routes
- **AND** does not force-navigate to another workspace page
- **AND** the plugin page remounts to the new generation

### Requirement: Plugin Management Page Shows Key Governance Information

The system SHALL prioritize key governance fields in the plugin management page.

#### Scenario: Source plugin type display
- **WHEN** plugin type is `source`
- **THEN** the management page shows "Source Plugin"

#### Scenario: Dynamic plugin type display
- **WHEN** plugin type is `dynamic`
- **THEN** the management page shows "Dynamic Plugin"

### Requirement: Frontend Plugin Page Discovery Must Support Empty Source Plugin Workspace

The host frontend SHALL complete build and runtime when the source plugin workspace does not exist or is empty. Plugin page auto-discovery must treat missing or empty plugin frontend directories as an empty page set, not a build error.

#### Scenario: Frontend build when plugin workspace does not exist
- **WHEN** host frontend build scans source plugin pages
- **AND** `apps/lina-plugins` does not exist
- **THEN** the plugin page module set is empty
- **AND** the frontend build continues executing

#### Scenario: Frontend build when plugin workspace is empty
- **WHEN** host frontend build scans source plugin pages
- **AND** `apps/lina-plugins` is an empty directory
- **THEN** the plugin page module set is empty
- **AND** frontend route registration does not create source plugin page entries

#### Scenario: After submodule initialization plugin pages participate in build
- **WHEN** `apps/lina-plugins` submodule initialization is complete
- **AND** source plugins provide `frontend/pages/` pages
- **THEN** host frontend build discovers these pages
- **AND** plugin pages continue participating in host routing and permission filtering
